# jalaziz.io

This is the source code for my site. It was generated by [Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) with the [OctoPanel](https://github.com/ConnorAtherton/OctoPanel) theme.

I modified the generated source directory to remove all plugins so the site would work on GitHub pages. I also tweaked various aspects of the theme.
